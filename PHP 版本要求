For php7.0 only

If your server doesn't have php 7.1 and above and you are only restricted to use php7.0 do as below:

Delete vendor folder
Delete composer.lock file
Add this to composer.json file under config

"platform": {
   "php": "7.0.0"
}
As well, ensure PHP version under require is set to 7.0.0 as shown below in config.platform.php:

    "config": {
        "platform": {
            "php": "7.0.0"
        }
     }
Run composer install using CMD
This now will make sure that only dependencies compatible with php7.0 are installed.
